Install Jekyll for GitHub
For mac, avoid sudo. Install homebrew before ruby, and ruby before jekyll.

Check if have homebrew
  brew update
If homebrew not found, then need to install.

Install Homebrew
/usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"

# install rbenv and ruby-build to manage multiple versions of Ruby
brew install rbenv

# setup rbenv integration to my shell
# Set up rbenv via brew, make sure to add this to shell config:
eval "$(rbenv init -)"

# check install
curl -fsSL https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv-installer/raw/master/bin/rbenv-doctor | bash

# you installed rbenv to manage multiple Ruby versions, but you don't actually have any ruby versions yet.
# install ruby versions like this: rbenv install 2.2.5, or use brew to get latest version:
brew install ruby

# check version
ruby -v

# restart terminal for changes to take effect
# install ruby version you want
rbenv install 2.5.1
rbenv global 2.5.1
ruby -v

# install jekyll
gem install bundler jekyll

# get error
